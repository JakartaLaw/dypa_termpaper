\section{Solving the model}

To solve this model we need to solve the following problem: find the function $\varphi$ that satisfies:

\begin{equation}
    \varphi : (\mu_t, f_t, a_t , e) \mapsto (c_t^{*}, t^{*}_t, \kappa_t^{*}), V^{*}(\cdot)
\end{equation}

In other words, for a given state space which action set/choice set should the agent take, if the agent wishes to maximize its cummulative utility during its lifecycle.

The bellman equation, is what allows to only consider two consequtive periods: $(t, t+1)$. We can solve the model, by backwards induction. Solve the model in period $T$, where the model terminates.
